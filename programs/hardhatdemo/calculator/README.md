# Sample Hardhat 3 Project (`node:test` and `viem`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 project using the native Node.js test runner (`node:test`) and the `viem` library for Ethereum interactions.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using [`node:test`](nodejs.org/api/test.html), the new Node.js native test runner, and [`viem`](https://viem.sh/).
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `node:test` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test nodejs
```

### Using the Counter web interface

1. Start a local Hardhat node in one terminal:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. Deploy the Counter to that node in another terminal:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat ignition deploy --network localhost ignition/modules/CounterWeb.ts
   ```

   Copy the deployed `Counter` address from the output.

3. Add the local network to your browser wallet with RPC URL `http://127.0.0.1:8545` and chain ID `31337`. Import one of the **local-only** test accounts and its private key printed by `hardhat node`. Never use these test keys for real funds.

4. Start the interface:

   ```shell
   npm run ui
   ```

5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`, connect the wallet, and enter the deployed contract address.

The interface reads the on-chain value and lets the connected account call `inc()` or `incBy(amount)`. Transactions require wallet approval.

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes an example Ignition module to deploy the contract. You can deploy this module to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

To run the deployment to a local chain:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with funds to send the transaction. The provided Hardhat configuration includes a Configuration Variable called `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`, which you can use to set the private key of the account you want to use.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

After setting the variable, you can run the deployment with the Sepolia network:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```
